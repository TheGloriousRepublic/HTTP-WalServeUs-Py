<p>So you have the server downloaded and, presumably, a website to host. Now, what to do, what to do? First, you'll need to set up the environment. This page tells exactly how to do that.</p>

<p>To avoid confusion, I would advise that you first delete the files <span class="filename">.gitattributes</span> and <span class="filename">.gitignore</span>, as these
    are simply files required for the website GitHub, which was used in the development of this server, to track the changes made over time. They are no longer of use and
    you are free to do what you please to them.</p>

<p>Next, you will need to add your document files to the server. If you designed your website in an builder, it will have outputted some files. These will have silly
    phrases after their names like  <span class="filename">.html</span> and <span class="filename">.css</span> and maybe even <span class="filename">.js</span>. If you
    had a Web Designer make these for you (which is a very good idea), he will have sent you these files. You may instead have a <span class="filename">.zip</span> file or
    (if you're particularly unlucky) a <span class="filename">.tar</span> or <span class="filename">.tar.gz</span>. If it's a zip you should be able to right click (control click
    on OSX) and extract it. On Windows the option will be "Extract All," while on Mac I'm not sure. If it's a tar or tar.gz, it'll be a bit of a hassle to retrieve. You'll
    need to go to the internet, install a program capable of extracting these compatible with your operating system (on windows I recommend WinRAR), and <i>then</i> right
    click the file and extract it.</p>

<p>Now that you have your hands on these files, there are two ways you can link these files to WalServeUs: the first, and simplest, is to
    put them in the default folder. To do this, open two windows in your computer's file browser (on Windows this is referred to as Windows Explorer or File explorer (not Internet Explorer), and on Mac this is called
    Finder.) In one window navigate to the place where you installed WalServeUs and open the "Pages" folder. If there's anything in there, delete it, as that is a relic of
    hppavilion1's personal use of WalServeUs. After you have deleted those, select all the HTML, CSS, JS, and any others (such as those that you want to behave like attachments in emails, downloadable from the website) and drag and drop them in to the pages folder.</p>

<p>The other method is a bit more involved. To learn about it, visit the document on <a href="config files.html">Configuration Files</a></p>
