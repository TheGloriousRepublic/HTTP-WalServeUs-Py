        <p>Hi. I'm Squishy the Technologically-Inclined Kitten. Seriously. That's my name.</p>
        <p>My job is to teach you how to use products developed by members of The Glorious Republic.</p>
        <p>Today, I am teaching you how to use the WalServeUs HTTP server, developed by hppavilion1. Your local installation of WalServeUs should contain the following files:
        <ul>
            <li>A folder named <span class="filename">config</span></li>
            <li>A folder named <span class="filename">errors</span></li>
            <li>A folder named <span class="filename">Help (for beginners)</span> that you will have clicked on to arrive here</li>
            <li>A folder named <span class="filename">logs</span></li>
            <li>A folder named <span class="filename">pages</span></li>
            <li>A file named <span class="filename">.gitattributes</span></li>
            <li>A file named <span class="filename">.gitignore</span></li>
        </ul>
        </p>
