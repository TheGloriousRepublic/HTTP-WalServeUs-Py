		<center><h1>Purely Functional Imperative Language</h1></center>
		<p>PFIL is, as the name suggests, an imperative programming language that is constructed entirely of functions. Not purely functional in the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming'>traditional sense</a>, where there are no state changes, but purely functional in that <strong>everything</strong> is a function. There are no statements. Only functions. For example, let's look at an if-then construct (without preprocessing):<p>
		
		<div class='code'>
		<span class='yellow'>if</span>(<span class='red'>not</span> <span class='yellow'>if</span>(<i>condition</i>){
		<br/>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class='blue'>doStuff</span>();
		<br/>
		}){
		<br/>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class='blue'>doOtherStuff</span>();
		<br/>
		}
		</div>
		
		<p>Now, if-then functions are, as the phrase "if-then functions" implies, functions. It's pretty obvious, honestly. However, they need to take a group of functions and execute
		them. Now how do they do that? The answer is that functions in this language can take <i>lambdas</i> (a special type that is essentially an executable block of code) as input
		and execute them!</p>
		
		<p>PFIL's philosophy is largely similar to that of Python: batteries-included. Also, it should look cool, and whatever other Python-lovers say, curly brackets and semicolons look awesome in code. It is a fact of life.</p>
