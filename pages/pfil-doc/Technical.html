		<p>PFIL, the Purely Functional Imperative Language, is an imperative, compiled, dynamically-typed, object-oriented, procedure-centric programming language inspired by all the best things
		of languages like Python and C and Haskell.<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">1</span><span class="refbody">You know it's weird when it's inspired by 3 totally different languages of opposing paradigms</span></span></p>
		
		<p>It is a semicolon/curly bracket language, as semicolons and curly brackets look good in code. Many may not like this, and as such a preprocessor should be made available
		(though this is <em>certainly</em> not required, as many will likely be made available by third parties) that will use pythonic syntax (Colons and indent to denote a block of
		code, newline (unless enclosed in certain delimiters) to denote end-of-line).</p>
