		<center><h1>The Purely Functional Imperative Language in the Command Line Interface</h1></center>
		
		<p>Like all compiled languages, the Purely Functional Imperative Language needs a compiler. And, as many compilers use the Command Line Interface, a syntax must be established.
		This chapter is more of a set of guidelines on how to design this syntax than strict rules.</p>
		
		<p>The basic syntax for this is <span class="cmd">[compiler name] [filepath]</span>. For example, to compile foo.pfil with the Arbitrary Imaginary Compiler (aic),
		you would use <span class="cmd">aic foo.pfil</span>. This would compile to a file named, for example, a.exe.</p>
		
		<p>If one wishes to control the output file, one uses the <span class="cmd">-o [outfilepath]</span> flag. If one were to use <span class="cmd">aic foo.pfil -o bar.exe</span>, it would
		do the same as in the previous example, except the outfile would be named bar.exe.</p>
		
		<p>If one wishes to go through the steps of compiler optimization on their file without compiling it, one would use the <span class="cmd">-po</span> flag (preprocess only). This will
		output a file with the same name as would happen if it did not use the -po flag, except this file will be a .pfil as opposed to a .exe, and the .pfil will be optimized.</p>
		
		<p>If one wishes to compile without proprocessing (which should only be done if the file was programmed in pure PFIL), one uses the <span class="cmd">-np</span> flag (no preprocessing).
		This will compile the file without using the preprocessor. If one uses both <span class="cmd">-po</span> and <span class="cmd">-np</span>, an error results.</p>
		
		<p>Some flags will override the compiling behavior of the program. <span class="cmd">-h</span> brings up a syntax file, and <span class="cmd">-v</span> displays the version of the compiler.</p>
		
		<p>I must repeat that these are simply guidelines for command-line-based compilers, and should be taken with a grain of salt. Things not mentioned here may definitely be incorporated, though 
		it is advised that all functionality described here be available in some form.</p>
