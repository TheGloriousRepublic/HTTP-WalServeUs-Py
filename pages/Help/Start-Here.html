        <p>Hi. I'm Squishy, the Technologically-Inclined Kitten. Seriously. That's my name.</p>
        <p>My job is to teach you how to use software developed by members of The Glorious Republic.</p>
        <p>Today, I am teaching you how to use the WalServeUs HTTP server, developed by hppavilion1. Your <span class="ref"><span class="refnum">local installation</span><span class="refbody">The folder you downloaded containing all the files</span></span> of WalServeUs should contain the following files:
        <ul>
            <li>A folder named <span class="filename">config</span></li>
            <li>A folder named <span class="filename">errors</span></li>
            <li>A folder named <span class="filename">Help (for beginners)</span> that you will have clicked on to arrive here</li>
            <li>A folder named <span class="filename">logs</span></li>
            <li>A folder named <span class="filename">pages</span></li>
            <li>A file named <span class="filename">.gitattributes</span> (a file that has to do with the way this was written)</li>
            <li>A file named <span class="filename">.gitignore</span> (ditto)</li>
            <li>A file named <span class="filename">README.md</span> (this is the more technical version of what you are currently reading)</li>
            <li>A file named <span class="filename">WalServeUs.py</span> (the file that everything runs on)</li>
        </ul>
        If you see any others, don't worry. This is probably just due to me forgetting. They probably don't matter to you anyways, as if they did I would have remembered them :P.
