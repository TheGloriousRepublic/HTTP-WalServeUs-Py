			<h1>Configuration</h1>

        <p>Sometimes, you'll want to change some of the basic settings for the WalServeUs server. Maybe you want (or have) to keep the website files in another directory, maybe there are
        some download filetypes that aren't supported by default, or maybe you want to do something else. If this is the case, then this is the page for you!</p>
    <p>Configuration files are arranged into 3 folders: <span class="filename">processors</span>, <span class="filename">rewriter</span> and <span class="filename">settings</span>. All the files in each of these folders are essentially combined within their folders then read upon startup (meaning you can divide them however you want, even in subfolders, provided you keep them in the correct parent folder.)</p>

        <div>
			<p>WalServeUs has various configurable settings that can be used to control the way it behaves. These setting control directories, what the user is allowed to access, etc.
        These settings are determined by creating a key/value pair (<span class="code">key=value</span>) on a line in a .cfg file in the config/settings folder. The settings are as such:
            <ul>
                <li>pgdir: the path to the directory where your html, css, js, etc. documents (that make up your website) to be stored</li>
                <li>erdir: the path to the directory where your error documents are stored.</li>
                <li>lgdir: the path to the directory containing your logs.</li>
                <li>rcdir: the path to the directory where files uploaded should be stored</li>
                <li>rcMax: A security setting dictating the maximum size of uploaded files</li>
                <li>pgexr: A list of file extensions separated by verticle bars (|) that should be read as raw text when sent. * will apply to any text file.</li>
                <li>pgexb: A list of file extensions separated by verticle bars (|) that should be read as binary when sent. * will apply to any binary file.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>These should be left alone unless dictated to you by a professional.</p>

        <h3><a href="#">Rewriter</a></h3>            
        <div>
			<p>Rewriter is the file group tasked with URLs. Have you ever noticed that some sites have a <span class="filename">.html</span> at the end of their URL? That's because of the
            way their website file works. When you enter a URL on these, it simply directly looks up the files in their local directory. You don't want to have to do that. It's icky. Instead,
            we will be using a simple system known as <i>Regular Expressions</i> to identify URLs to redesign.</p>

        <p>A regular expression is simple: You have a pattern, and the pattern is matched. I'm not going to go into complex regular expressions here, just the basics.</p>

        <p>A rewritten URL is formatted like so: <span class="code">[rewritten url regex]=[path]</span>. Now, don't worry, it's simple.</p>

        <p>When you write a URL regex (short for Regular Expression), you likely want it to match the beginning and end of path. You could make it so that
            <a href="www.example.com/folder/page/">www.example.com/folder/page/</a> and <a href="www.example.com/folder/folder/folder/page/">www.example.com/folder/folder/folder/page/</a>
            both lead to the same URL, but I doubt you want that. So to prevent that from happening, put a ^ at the front of the regex and $ at the end. This will tell the server that you want
            the path to match the URL start and end.</p>

        <p>So for writing your regex, you'll want to start with a /. This tells the regex to start at your base pages folder. Next, type the url you want (after the domain name). For example,
            if your URL is in <a href="www.example.com/subpages">www.example.com/subpages</a>, your path would be <span class="filename">/subpages</span> making your regex <span class="filename">^/subpages/$</span>.
            You now have a regex for matching your URLs! Oh, you'll want to add an equals sign after it to tell the server that which part is the path and which part is the URL.
        </p>
        <p>All that's left is to match the path. Simply start from the top folder (<span class="filename">pages</span> by default) and find the path down. For example, if the file you
            want is <span class="filename">example.html</span> in the <span class="filename">examples</span> folder, your path would be <span class="filename">examples/example.html</span>.
            If the files is not in a subfolder of <span class="filename">pages</span>, simply type the filename. Repeat this process on a new line for each url match. When you save the document and restart the server, typing the URL you want
        <i>should</i>, if everything was done correctly, lead you to the file you desire.</p>
        <p>One more thing on the topic of regexes that you can use for URLs: There are special symbols regexes use to match things. These operators are <span class="code">*, +, ?</span>.
            When you use one, it will match a certain pattern of the part before it or, if it is put after a closing parenthesis, the entirety of that to that parenthesis' partner. The *
            will match 0-infinity of the preceding block, the + will match one to infinity, and the ? will match 0-1. These could be useful for things like matching both the British and
            American spellings of words (e.g. color vs. colour) in a URL.</p>

        <h3><a href="#">Processors</a></h3>
        <div>
			<p>Processors are things that take a page before it's sent to the user and convert it into what you want them to see. They are typically installed as plugins, by dragging and dropping a <span class="filename">.py</span> file into your <span class="filename">plugins</span> folder. The next time you run the file, a new file ending with <span class="filename">.pyc</span> is created.
			<p>They are quite simple: you just use the <span class="code">key=value</span> format to match file extensions to names. Hopefully, when you download a plugin, it came with a readme file. This should tell you what to do. <b>WARNING: NEVER PUT ANYTHING THAT LOOKS LIKE CODE INTO YOUR PROCESSORS FILE, AS IT COULD SURPRISINGLY EASILY INSTALL A VIRUS</b></p>
