        <h1>Setting Up</h1>
    </center>

    <p>Hopefully, you also now have the website on a computer which you can keep running 24/7. Now, what to do, what to do? First, you'll need to set up the <span class="ref"><span class="refnum">environment</span><span class="refbody">Arrangement of your computer and available files such that your server will be able to run properly</span></span>. This page tells exactly how to do that.</p>

    <p> For starters, navigate to where you installed WalServeUs. To avoid confusion, I would advise that you first delete the files <span class="filename">.gitattributes</span> and <span class="filename">.gitignore</span>, as these
        are simply files required for <span class="ref"><span class="refnum">GitHub</span><span class="refbody">The website used throughout the development of the server, for tracking the changes made over time</span></span>. They are no longer of use and
        you are free to do what you please to them.</p>

    <p>Next, you will need to add your document files to the server. If you designed your website in an builder, it will have outputted some files. These will have silly
        phrases after their names like  <span class="filename">.html</span> and <span class="filename">.css</span> and maybe even <span class="filename">.js</span> <strong>WARNING: IF ONE OF THE FILES IS A <span class="filename">.php</span>, THE WalServeUs HOSTING SOFTWARE WILL NOT WORK. SORRY :/.<sup><span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[note]</span><span class="refbody">Depending on the popularity of the HTTP-WalServeUs software when you are using this, there may be a plugin you can use.</span></span></sup></strong> If you
        had a Web Designer make these for you (which is generally a good idea, but not necessary), he will have sent you these files. You may instead have a <span class="filename">.zip</span> file or
        (if you're particularly unlucky) a <span class="filename">.tar</span> or <span class="filename">.tar.gz</span>. If it's a zip you should be able to right click (control click
        on Mac) and extract it. On Windows the option will be "Extract All," while on Mac I'm not sure. If it's a <span class="filename">.tar</span> or <span class="filename">.tar.gz</span>, it'll be a bit of a hassle to retrieve. You'll
        need to go to the internet, install a program capable of extracting these compatible with your operating system (on Windows I recommend WinRAR), and <i>then</i> right
        click the file and extract it.</p>

    <p>Now that you have your hands on these files, there are two ways you can link these files to WalServeUs: the first, and simplest, is to
        put them in the default folder. To do this, open two windows in your computer's file browser (on Windows this is referred to as Windows Explorer or File explorer (not Internet Explorer), and on Mac this is called
        Finder.) In one window navigate to the place where you installed WalServeUs and open the "Pages" folder. If there's anything in there, delete it (EXCEPT the <span class="filename">Help</span> folder, as that will make it so you can no longer read these helpful documents.), as that is a relic of
        hppavilion1's personal use of WalServeUs. After you have deleted those, select all the HTML, CSS, JS, and any others (such as those that you want to behave like attachments in emails, downloadable from the website)
        and drag and drop them in to the pages folder.</p>

    <p>The other method is a bit more involved. To learn about it, visit the document on <a href="config">Configuration Files</a></p>
