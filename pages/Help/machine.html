        <h1>Your Server Machine</h1>
    </center>
    <p>So you have the server downloaded and, presumably, a website to host. Well, I'm sorry to tell you this, and I would have done so sooner if it were possible, but you might be running on the wrong machine.</p>

    <p>To host a website 24/7 requires that the server (computer) hosting it be turned on and running the software 100% of the time, except maybe the occasional reboot. This is where dedicated server machines come in.</p>

    <p>Basically, you need an old, otherwise useless computer, preferably running a recent OS though. What you need to do is get all the files you want off, factory reset it so nothing is cluttering the drive, then copy
        this entire folder (starting at the folder named 'HTTP-WalServeUs') over to that computer, or simply redownload it over there. The computer should be put somewhere where it has
        a constant power source and should be set to NEVER automatically turn off or go to screensaver or ANYTHING. All further actions taken should be taken on that computer.</p>

    <p>Oh, and you might want to make the WalServeUs script boot at startup, too.</p>

    <p>Now that you've got the Dedicated Server Machine, you should start <a href="setup">setting up</a> the files...</p>
