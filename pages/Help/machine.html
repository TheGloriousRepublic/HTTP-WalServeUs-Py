        <h1>Your Server Machine</h1>
    </center>
    <p>So you have the server downloaded and, presumably, a website to <span class="ref"><span class="refnum">host</span><span class="refbody">To make available for all to see, via the great network we call the Internet</span></span>. Well, I'm sorry to tell you this, and I would have done so sooner if it were possible, but you might be running on the wrong machine.</p>

    <p>To host a website 24/7 requires that the <span class="ref"><span class="refnum">server</span><span class="refbody">A server can be one of two things: The server software (The one you're using is WalServeUS), which is what keeps everything running, or the server machine, which is the device on which the server software runs. You'll need to infer from context which one I'm talking about</span></span> hosting it be turned on and running the software 100% of the time, except maybe the occasional <span class="ref"><span class="refnum">reboot</span><span class="refbody">Turning a computer off and back on</span></span>. This is where dedicated server machines come in.</p>

    <p>Basically, you need an old, otherwise useless computer, running a recent <span class="ref"><span class="refnum">OS</span><span class="refbody">Operating System, like Windows 7 or Mac OSX</span></span>. (Preferable: Windows 7, as WalServeUs was <span class="ref"><span class="refnum">developed and debugged</span><span class="refbody">Made and Tested</span></span> entirely on Windows 7. It <em>should</em> work on <span class="ref"><span class="refnum">Unix</span><span class="refbody">The operating system used by God</span></span> systems and OSX though.) What you need to do is get all the files you want off, <span class="ref"><span class="refnum">factory reset</span><span class="refbody">Set it so it has no extra files on it. You'll have to use google for this. Just type &quot;&lt;Your OS&gt; factory reset&quot; into your favorite search engine (e.g. Google)</span></span> it so nothing is cluttering the drive, then copy
        this entire folder (starting at the folder named 'HTTP-WalServeUs') over to that computer, or simply redownload it over there. The computer should be put somewhere where it has
        a constant power source and should be set to NEVER automatically turn off or go to screensaver or ANYTHING. All further actions taken should be taken on that computer.</p>

    <p>Oh, and you might want to make the WalServeUs script boot at startup, too.</p>

    <p>Now that you've got the Dedicated Server Machine, you should start <a href="/help/setup">setting up</a> the files...</p>
